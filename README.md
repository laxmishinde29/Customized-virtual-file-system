### **📁 Customised Virtual File System (CVFS)**

## 📌 Project Overview
• Customised Virtual File System (CVFS) is a simulation of a simplified file system built from scratch to emulate core file system behaviors.

• It demonstrates file manipulation, storage logic, and system-level interactions similar to UNIX/Linux systems.

• It is a simulation of a simple file system that mimics core file operations like open, read, write, and close. It demonstrates how files are managed internally by the OS using inodes, file tables, and directory structures. 

• The project provides a hands-on understanding of system calls, file metadata, and memory organization within a controlled virtual environment.

• Known as customized virtual files system:-
Customised : Because its designed is dependent on the users requirement
Virtual : Because it is used in the RAM.
File System : Way of storing and retriving the files.

## **⚙️ Technologies Used**
• Language: C / C++
 
• OS: Linux
